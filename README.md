#Realtime BART Display

A realtime transit display meant for a kiosk with no user interaction.  It shows realtime arrivals of BART trains.  It allows the user to select a station and choose whether or not to show background images.

It is perfect for a display at a coffee shop, office or other public place near a BART station.
